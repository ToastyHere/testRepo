## Your Response
Hi Julia,

Happy to help you in implementing Algolia. Looking at the website there appears to be an error in the consoles log.

I believe the cause of the error is just a typo in the script tag at the bottom of the HTML page. It currently references the file "instantsearchmin.js", however looking at the [instantsearch.js CDN repository](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4.33.2/dist/) no such files is available there. The file should be called "instantsearch.production.min.js"

Changing the script tags source to reference "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4/dist/instantsearch.production.min.js" instead should resolve your issue.

Please dont hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions!
Kind Regards,
Ciaran

Is repository the right word to use there?
